## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

With a background in tech-education and a passion for software development, I am eager to transition to a role where I can apply my skills. I attended Makers Academy in summer 2023, where I acquired the critical skills necessary to succeed as a full-stack developer, quality assurance engineer, and database developer. Following my bootcamp experience, I immediately began teaching full-time as an Engineering Trainer at La Fosse Academy. There, I instructed a class of 19 students in developing fully tested web apps using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I ensured their success by conducting live coding workshops, writing academic curriculum, and reviewing student code for quality. I am passionate about technology and frequently volunteer to coach and speak at events, connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm.

| **[Group project - GigGuru](https://github.com/Raphael40/gig-guru)**                   | A web app that allows users to sign up for accounts, set their location and locate upcoming music events for that area. It uses the ticket master API to source the events and the Google API to display the location of the concert. For this project we wanted to improve our MERN stack fundamentals and work with API's                                                                                      | MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs, Jest, Cypress, Postman |
| **[Group Project - RuBnB](https://github.com/Raphael40/RuBnB)**                        | The app allows a user to create an account and add listings that can be rented out over a range of dates. Users can also browse other users' listings and request to book them. It uses three tables connected to each other in a relational database and implements .erb files for its page views. Understanding relational database architecture and testing in depth with RSpec were crucial for our success. | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Postman, TablePlus              |
| **[Solo Project - News-Summary](https://github.com/Raphael40/news-summary-challenge)** | A single-page web app that grabs and displays all the headlines from the Guardian Newspaper API. The search bar can be used to filter the results by topic and the headings are links to the original articles. The highlights of this project were learning async programming and using a bundler file.                                                                                                         | Javascript, HTML, CSS, Guardian API, Jest, Jest-Fetch-Mock        |
| **[Solo Project - Workout-Planner](https://github.com/Raphael40/MERN-stack-workout)**  | A single-page app that allows users to create, view, and delete workouts. Each workout is stored in MongoDB-Atlas and the frontend is made with React for fast and responsive rendering of database items. I have recently revisited this app to add end-to-end testing.                                                                                                                                         | MongoDB-Atlas, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS       |

## üíª Coding Experience

**Engineering Trainer [La Fosse Academy](https://makers.tech/)**

- Led technical coding workshops for a class of 19 students, providing starter code repositories and running hands-on implementation sessions. Achieved a 100% pass rate in assessments, with six students scoring full marks.
- Enhanced course curriculum by adding new content, including upgrade of Node API testing lecture with unit tests. Following this, backend test coverage in student projects rose.
- Provided group feedback for student projects resulting in highly functional and visually appealing websites. Delivered 1-2-1 feedback resulting in improved technical and communicative skills for all students.
- Improved my programming fundamentals, boosting personal project quality and gaining the knowledge to create a structured software training course.

**Software Engineering Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)**

- Since I started Makers I have crafted applications such as an Airbnb clone and a concert finder using different technology stacks, notably MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and RSP (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL).
- Working here built my teamwork and leadership skills in pair-programming and group projects by practicing navigator and driver roles with an agile methodology that helps by breaking the work down into basic steps. Understanding Github‚Äôs collaboration function has been invaluable.
- Learning how to test code with frameworks like Rspec, Jest, Cypress, and Playwrite has been one of my biggest achievements. I understand the principles of test-driven development and am the author of multiple applications that incorporate unit, component, and end-to-end tests.
- On top of boosting my technical ability, I have also made a network with other aspiring students to work on new projects. My next idea is to collaboratively develop a fully tested React Native ‚ÄòTesco meal-deal streak app‚Äô that displays how often one has meal deals and lets you earn achievements for eating them on consecutive days.

**Codebar Workshops**

- Volunteer coding coach at CodeBar, a charity providing free weekly programming workshops to minority groups.
- Enhanced skills in program architecture, debugging, and code refactoring while coaching at CodeBar.
- Recieved positive feedback for helping debug a weather app. Student now works as a front end developer.

## üñäÔ∏è Professional Experience

**Web Support Specialist at CIBSE** (April 2022 ‚Äì April 2023)

- I was initially onboarded for three months to help the company transfer its website to a new content management system. We successfully moved from Kentico to Umbraco within the deadline.
- Designed and populated webpages using the Umbraco content management system. Some examples are the Societies page, the News page, and the Registration page.
- I was taught to use Salesforce and assisted multiple departments by managing committees, writing reports, proofreading emails, registering training sessions, and uploading membership data.
- Thanks to my work with CIBSE I learned about UI & UX design, cloud storage, and content management systems. I also gained a year of experience in a professional office environment.
