## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

As an ambitious adventurer, I have always sought new experiences in different areas, leading me to enter the world of tech. It would seem I have found my calling because the endless possibilities of code and seeing a project come to life are things I could never move on from. 

After six months of self-taught coding involving Codecademy, lots of Codewars, and regular attendance at Codebar meetups, I decided to boost my career potential by joining Makers Academy. At Makers, I honed my skills and learned best practices in programming, including test-driven developement, .git version control, and detailed program design. I particularly value the opportunity to callaboratively develop full-stack projects with other like-minded individuals. A video demonstration can be seen here: [Gig-Guru](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qEGz2Pb425fBRtFN7)

I take great pride in the progress I have made and continuously strive to create more complex and efficient projects. Moreover, I have been captivated by the tech community, where interesting and like-minded people not only inspire me but also provide valuable guidance and support. This is why I have become so passionate about programming.


## üìñ Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Group project - GigGuru](https://github.com/Raphael40/gig-guru)**           | A web app that allows users to sign up for accounts, set their location and locate upcoming music events for that area. It uses the ticket master API to source the events and the Google API to display the location of the concert. For this project we wanted to improve our MERN stack fundamentals and work with API's | MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs, Jest, Cypress, Postman |
| **[Group Project - RuBnB](https://github.com/Raphael40/RuBnB)** | The app allows a user to create an account and add listings that can be rented out over a range of dates. Users can also browse other users' listings and request to book them. Users can check requests made on their listings and choose whether to accept them. This was our first group prjoject and we had a focus on realtional database architececture and how it interacts with the program. | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Postman, TablePlus |
| **[Solo Project - News-Summary](https://github.com/Raphael40/news-summary-challenge)** | A single-page web app that grabs all the headlines from the Guardian Newspaper API and displays them on a page. For me, this project was extremely important for understanding how to make fetch requests and manipulate JSON data. | Javascript, HTML, CSS, Guardian API, Jest, Jest-Fetch-Mock |
| **[Solo Project - Workout-Planner](https://github.com/Raphael40/MERN-stack-workout)** | A single page app that allows users to create and manage workouts. The frontend is built using React, and the backend is powered by MongoDB Atlas. | MongoDB-Atlas, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS |

## üíª Coding Experience

**Software Engineering Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)**
- During my four months at this company, I've successfully crafted a variety of web applications using different technology stacks, notably MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and RSP (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL).
- Working here helped not only refine my coding abilities and deepen my comprehension of programming architecture but also enhance my teamwork and leadership skills through pair-programming and collaborative projects.
- One of the most significant learning experiences involved mastering Test-Driven Development practices. By utilizing test suites such as Rspec, Jest, and Cypress, I developed fully-tested applications encompassing unit, component, and end-to-end tests.
- Overcoming the challenge of mocking APIs was a significant milestone, greatly bolstering my confidence in this aspect. For a more detailed insight into my major projects, please refer to my GitHub profile linked above.

**Codebar Workshops**
- I have attended over 20 [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) workshops since I began my journey a year ago. The first time I ever used Javascript and .git/GitHub were in Codebar sessions.
- Through Codebar I cooperated with many other aspiring developers to encourage and inspire each other. Moreover, I recieved quality tuition and advice from senior develpers that kindly shared their time with me.
- I recently attended my first session as a coach rather than a student. It felt great to give back to the community and I really enjoyed helping my student debug her weather app.
