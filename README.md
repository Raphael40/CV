## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

With a background in tech-education and a passion for software development, I am eager to transition to a role where I can apply my skills. I attended Makers Academy in summer 2023, where I acquired the critical skills necessary to succeed as a full-stack developer, quality assurance engineer, and database developer. Following my Bootcamp experience, I immediately began teaching full-time as an Engineering Trainer at La Fosse Academy. There, I instructed a class of 19 students in developing fully tested web apps using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I ensured their success by conducting live coding workshops, writing academic curriculum, and reviewing student code for quality. I am passionate about technology and frequently volunteer to coach and speak at events, connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm.
