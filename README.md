## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

As an ambitious adventurer, I have always sought new experiences in different areas, leading me to enter the world of tech. It would seem I have found my calling because the endless possibilities of coding and seeing a project come to life are things I could never move on from. 

After six months of self-taught coding involving Codecademy, lots of Codewars, and regular attendance at Codebar workshops, I decided to boost my career potential by joining Makers Academy. At Makers, I honed my skills and learned the core principles of test-driven development, Git version control, frameworks, and database architecture. During my learning, I frequently programmed in collaborative environments, through pair programming on coding exercises or working on large-scale team projects, as both a contributor and a leader.

I take great pride in the progress I have made and continuously strive to create more complex and efficient projects. Moreover, I have been captivated by the tech community, where interesting and like-minded people not only inspire me but also provide valuable guidance and support. I am now ready to work full-time as a developer who can reliably produce and maintain high-quality code.



## üìñ Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Group project - GigGuru](https://github.com/Raphael40/gig-guru)**           | A web app that allows users to sign up for accounts, set their location and locate upcoming music events for that area. It uses the ticket master API to source the events and the Google API to display the location of the concert. For this project we wanted to improve our MERN stack fundamentals and work with API's | MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs, Jest, Cypress, Postman |
| **[Group Project - RuBnB](https://github.com/Raphael40/RuBnB)** | The app allows a user to create an account and add listings that can be rented out over a range of dates. Users can also browse other users' listings and request to book them. It uses three tables connected to each other in a relational database and implements .erb files for its page views. Understanding relational database architecture and testing in depth with RSpec were crucial for our success. | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Postman, TablePlus |
| **[Solo Project - News-Summary](https://github.com/Raphael40/news-summary-challenge)** | A single-page web app that grabs and displays all the headlines from the Guardian Newspaper API. The search bar can be used to filter the results by topic and the headings are links to the original articles. The highlights of this project were learning async programming and using a bundler file. | Javascript, HTML, CSS, Guardian API, Jest, Jest-Fetch-Mock |
| **[Solo Project - Workout-Planner](https://github.com/Raphael40/MERN-stack-workout)** | A single-page app that allows users to create, view, and delete workouts. Each workout is stored in MongoDB-Atlas and the frontend is made with React for fast and responsive rendering of database items. I have recently revisited this app to add end-to-end testing. | MongoDB-Atlas, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS |

## üíª Coding Experience

**Software Engineering Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)**
- Since I started Makers I have crafted applications such as an Airbnb clone and a concert finder using different technology stacks, notably MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and RSP (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL).
- Working here built my teamwork and leadership skills in pair-programming and group projects by practicing navigator and driver roles with an agile methodology that helps by breaking the work down into basic steps. Understanding Github‚Äôs collaboration function has been invaluable.
- Learning how to test code with frameworks like Rspec, Jest, Cypress, and Playwrite has been one of my biggest achievements. I understand the principles of test-driven development and am the author of multiple applications that incorporate unit, component, and end-to-end tests.
- On top of boosting my technical ability, I have also made a network with other aspiring students to work on new projects. My next idea is to collaboratively develop a fully tested React Native ‚ÄòTesco meal-deal streak app‚Äô that displays how often one has meal deals and lets you earn achievements for eating them on consecutive days.


**Codebar Workshops**
- I have attended over 20 Codebar workshops since I began my journey a year ago, and it was through these sessions that I had my initial experiences with Javascript and GitHub.
- Through Codebar I shared ideas with other aspiring developers and received quality tuition and advice from senior engineers from companies like Google and the Financial Times.
- I recently attended my first session as a coach!! It felt great to give back to the community and developing the ability to teach complex programming concepts at such an early stage of my career is a huge achievement.


## üñäÔ∏è Professional Experience

**Web Support Specialist at CIBSE** (April 2022 ‚Äì April 2023)
- I was initially onboarded for three months to help the company transfer its website to a new content management system. We successfully moved from Kentico to Umbraco within the deadline.
- Designed and populated webpages using the Umbraco content management system. Some examples are the Societies page, the News page, and the Registration page.
- I was taught to use Salesforce and assisted multiple departments by managing committees, writing reports, proofreading emails, registering training sessions, and uploading membership data.
- Thanks to my work with CIBSE I learned about UI & UX design, cloud storage, and content management systems. I also gained a year of experience in a professional office environment. 


**Tradewind & Sanza** (September 2021 ‚Äì April 2022)  
_Teaching Assistant_
- Worked with special educational needs students to improve their academic ability by conducting one-on-one tutorials in maths and philosophy. 
- Supported staff in the classroom by helping prepare materials, recording the students‚Äô progress, and looking after students that were unwell or hurt.
- Supervised after-school homework club and participated in extra-curricular sporting activities.
