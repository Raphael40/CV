## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

With a background in tech-education and a passion for software development, I am eager to transition to a role where I can apply my skills. I attended Makers Academy in summer 2023, where I acquired the critical skills necessary to succeed as a full-stack developer, quality assurance engineer, and database developer. Following my bootcamp experience, I immediately began teaching full-time as an Engineering Trainer at La Fosse Academy. There, I instructed a class of 19 students in developing fully tested web apps using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I ensured their success by conducting live coding workshops, writing academic curriculum, and reviewing student code for quality. I am passionate about technology and frequently volunteer to coach and speak at events, connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm.

| **[Group project - GigGuru](https://github.com/Raphael40/gig-guru)**                   | A web app that allows users to sign up for accounts, set their location and locate upcoming music events for that area. It uses the ticket master API to source the events and the Google API to display the location of the concert. For this project we wanted to improve our MERN stack fundamentals and work with API's                                                                                      | MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs, Jest, Cypress, Postman |
| **[Group Project - RuBnB](https://github.com/Raphael40/RuBnB)**                        | The app allows a user to create an account and add listings that can be rented out over a range of dates. Users can also browse other users' listings and request to book them. It uses three tables connected to each other in a relational database and implements .erb files for its page views. Understanding relational database architecture and testing in depth with RSpec were crucial for our success. | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Postman, TablePlus              |
| **[Solo Project - News-Summary](https://github.com/Raphael40/news-summary-challenge)** | A single-page web app that grabs and displays all the headlines from the Guardian Newspaper API. The search bar can be used to filter the results by topic and the headings are links to the original articles. The highlights of this project were learning async programming and using a bundler file.                                                                                                         | Javascript, HTML, CSS, Guardian API, Jest, Jest-Fetch-Mock        |
| **[Solo Project - Workout-Planner](https://github.com/Raphael40/MERN-stack-workout)**  | A single-page app that allows users to create, view, and delete workouts. Each workout is stored in MongoDB-Atlas and the frontend is made with React for fast and responsive rendering of database items. I have recently revisited this app to add end-to-end testing.                                                                                                                                         | MongoDB-Atlas, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS       |
