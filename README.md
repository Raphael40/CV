## About Me

As an ambitious adventurer, I have always sought new experiences in different areas, leading me to enter the world of tech. It would seem I have found my calling because the endless possibilities of code and seeing a project come to life are things I could never move on from. 

After six months of self-taught coding involving Codecademy, lots of Codewars, and regular attendance at Codebar meetups, I decided to boost my career potential by joining Makers Academy. At Makers, I honed my skills and learned best practices in programming, including test-driven developement, .git version control, and detailed program design. I particularly value the opportunity to callaboratively develop full-stack projects with other like-minded individuals.

I take great pride in the progress I have made and continuously strive to create more complex and efficient projects. Moreover, I have been captivated by the tech community, where interesting and like-minded people not only inspire me but also provide valuable guidance and support. This is why have become so passionate about programming.
